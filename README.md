## Aim / Purpose
Online Malaria Detector - Detects sample weather it is infected with malaria or not this model uses CNN (convolutional neural network) for classifying the images ,This project aims to demonstrate how online disease prediction/detection through Machine learning can save time and prove helpful for remote areas and villages also this helps in digitalization of records and error free mechanism saving time  cost and energy

## About

This webapp was developed using Flask Web Framework and was deployed on Heroku server. The models used to predict the diseases were trained on large Datasets. All the links for datasets and the python notebooks used for model creation are mentioned below in this readme. The webapp can predict following Diseases:
## Future scope

Multiple Disease detectors can be made by taking more accurate datasets training the models model for various diseases. 
Sytem if efficiently Designed will be helpful in faster report generation and treatment decreasing workload.
This system will have Digital copy of medical records and will provehelpful in telemedicine and virtual consultancy.
Saves Time work and energy gives error free result. 
People living in Remote areas and villages they can get their sample report to their mobiles and would reduce the travel to hospital everytime.
Overall wil;l result in Developing smart healtyh Ecosystem.



- **Malaria**

## Models with their Accuracy of Prediction

| Disease        | Type of Model            | Accuracy |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| Malaria     |    Deep Learning Model(CNN) | 96%      |
